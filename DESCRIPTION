Description: Create and integrate maps in your R workflow. This package helps 
    to design cartographic representations such as proportional symbols, 
    choropleth, typology, flows or discontinuities maps. It also offers several 
    features that improve the graphic presentation of maps, for instance, map 
    palettes, layout elements (scale, north arrow, title...), labels or legends.
